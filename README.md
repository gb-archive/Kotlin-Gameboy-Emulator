# KGB (Kotlin-Gameboy-Emulator)
A Gameboy emulator written in Kotlin.

## Can I use this emulator to play?
Yes you can, but you shouldn't. There are a lot more capable emulators available. 
This is a work in progress personal project with the aim for me to learn about emulation.

## Downloads
See [releases](https://github.com/stan-roelofs/Kotlin-Gameboy-Emulator/releases)

## Tests status
See [blargg_tests.md](blargg_tests.md) and [mooneye_tests.md](mooneye_tests.md).

## Features
- Runs on Windows, Linux and Mac.
- Video RAM debugger which can be used to view tiles that are currently in the video RAM.
- OAM debugger which can be used to view the sprites and their properties that are currently in the OAM.

## Status
Some games are playable but there is an issue where sprites are missing in some games. Audio is currently not implemented. Currently the focus is on passing the mooneye and blargg test roms to make the emulator more accurate. ROM Only and MBC1 cartridges are supported.

## Notes
This emulator is for the original Game Boy (DMG) and the versions A,B,C of the CPU.
